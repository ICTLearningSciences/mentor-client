My name is EMC Clint Anderson, that's Electrician's Mate Clinton Anderson.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.040
 of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 after graduating from high school, then I joined the United States

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.160
 Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.230
 carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.290
 go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.350
 and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.410
 fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.470
 quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.540
 education benefits that we received and I started going to the University

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.600
 of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.660
 and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.730
 of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.790
 Creative Technologies. It's been a lot of fun, this whole time. Thanks

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.850
 to the Navy.
