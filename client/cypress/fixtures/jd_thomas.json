Prior to coming to MPs, I was the A ops and the as well for a desert on staff in Mayport, Florida Prior to my second tour, I was four deployed on the USS Lassen and you Kuska Japan as the repair officer and the C E Devil. I was there for about 20 months, and my first tour probably was the most challenging tour today. There was a lot of ups and downs of my division. My division was composed of about 27 personnel. We had a couple of newly frakked first classes, so it was a lot of junior sailors. So we all had a huge learning curves like You get around together, of course, being in damage control and owning the all the fire equipment, the toilets, sinks and everything. You know, of course, things break and you know you're responsible for that kind of stuff. So it's nonstop 20 months tour, so I felt very challenging, but at same time is very rewarding. Prior to reaching the USS Lassen, I was enlisted for two years as a undesignated airman in a Halo squadron out in Jacksonville, Florida HSM 70 um prior to enlisting, served as a ah therapist in a rehab center in one of the local hospitals back where I'm from in Georgia.
